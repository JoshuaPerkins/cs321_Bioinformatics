*Btree = giant array
*First 4096 bytes used for BTree metadata'
*Offset zero in the file will be the pointer to root
*All data will be 64 bit longs
*Max sub sequence size = 31 characters
*No matter the sub sequence size, write 64 bits to array
*Node size = 4096 bytes
*Node Metadata
	1. parent_pointer - 4 bytes 
	2. number_of_children - 4 bytes
	3. isLeaf - 1 bytes (15 empty)
	- 9 bytes total, 24 bytes word aligned
*Key size = 64 bits = 8 bytes
*meta-data of single node + size of pointer (to parent) + size of key*(2t - 1) + size of pointer (to children) * 2t = 4096
	- 12 + 12(2t-1) + 4*2t = 4096
	- 32t = 4096
	- t = 128
*Node Structure
	1. Metadata (24 Bytes, offset = 0)
	2. 255 Keys(Tree Objects) (3060 Bytes, offset = 24)
	3. 256 Children Pointers (1024 Bytes, offset = 3084)

If the name of the GeneBank file is xyz.gbk, the sequence length is k, the BTree degree is t,
then the name of the btree file should be xyz.gbk.btree.data.k.t.
